# Supporting your peers' growth as a tech lead by [Alon Kiriati](https://twitter.com/akiriati)
As an experienced individual contributor you might believe that all you should care about is your own growth — after all you are an “individual” contributor.

In this talk I’ll explain why `caring for your team` shouldn’t be unique to just your manager, and how it could `make you a better professional`.
We will cover the challenges and advantages that you could face, and also share practical tips to help your peers thrive in their work.

## Career ladder
![Ladder one path](img/supporting-your-peers-growth/ladder-one-path.jpg)
- Stop vertical career ladder
    - Good dev vs good manager
    - Single career path
    - You lose the best dev and you get a bad manager
- Alternative : `Y shaped`

- Good things take time :
    - Short term : 
        - more time
        - potentially lower quality
        - double work
    - Long term : 
        - reducing bottleneck
        - higher satisfaction
        - can be more strategic 
    
## Ensure safety net
- Should you delegate ? (decision tree)
    - Not sensitive ?
    - Not urgent ?
